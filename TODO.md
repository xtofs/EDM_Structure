# TODO - OData EDM Structure Project

## ✅ COMPLETED: Flattened Element Structure

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Successfully implemented on `feature/flatten-element-structure` branch

**What was implemented:**
- Transformed nested `elementGroups[].elements[]` structure to flat `elements[]` array
- Added `elementGroups[]` array containing only group metadata with `id` field  
- Each element now has a `group` property referencing the group ID
- Updated TypeScript interfaces in `src/types.ts`
- Updated parser methods in `src/parser.ts` to work with flat structure
- Updated generator methods in `src/generator.ts` to work with flat structure
- Updated CLI statistics display to match new data structure
- All existing functionality preserved with identical output

**Benefits achieved:**
- Simpler data structure that's easier to query and manipulate
- Elements can be accessed directly without nested loops
- Group information maintained through clean references
- Better separation of element data and grouping metadata
- Improved performance for element lookups

**Original proposal:**
> The grouping of elements in the JSON file leads to really nice grouping in the markdown
> But I think it shouldn't be done with actual nesting in JSON.

The implementation successfully addresses this by moving to a flat structure while preserving all grouping information and markdown output quality.
